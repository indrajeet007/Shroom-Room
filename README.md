# Shroom Room

## Getting Started

Clone the project, launch in Xcode. Model file has not been included, but i'll add a detailed procedure to create your own models in future! No rocket science, its all about using Tensorflow's Transfer Learning technique.

### Prerequisites

Xcode: 9.0+
iOS Version: 11.4+

## Built With

* [expanding-collection](https://github.com/Ramotion/expanding-collection) - UI Element
* [circle-menu](https://github.com/Ramotion/circle-menu) - UI Element - Circle Menu
* [Classifying Images with Vision and Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/classifying_images_with_vision_and_core_ml) - Sample iOS App for ML Object Recognition

## Deployment

This is not a complete project but served as a college project submission. Huge plans to update this further, but till then no major advancement. Not live deployable project!

## Acknowledgments

* Ramotion (www.ramotion.com) - Awesome open-source libraries for UI development
* Tensorflow - Framework allowing to build the complete detection pipeline
* Google Images - Training Images for dataset
* Apple Vision Library - Allowing handling user input through camera or photos
